This site holds the official documentation for Project Sicario, and how to build mods for the platform.

Please note that this site is specifically intended for **mod authors** looking to **build mods for Sicario**, not for users building mods. If you're looking for a merged mod, head back to [the app](/build) and start building!

If you're looking for information on how to actually build a patch, or reimplement your existing blueprint mods as mergeable Sicario patches, then read through the docs using the sections on the left.

> For queries about these documentations or this Sicario server, please contact `@agc93#0001` on Discord, or [raise an issue on GitHub](https://github.com/agc93/project-sicario)
