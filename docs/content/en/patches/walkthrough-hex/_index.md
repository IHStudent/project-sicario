The docs in this section will walk you through the basics of a {{< appName >}} mod, focussing on the basic structure and format of a {{< shortName >}} mod file, but specifically aimed at creating hex/binary patches. Note that this is a legacy (but supported) method and we don't recommend using this unless required.

If you're new to this, I recommend working through the articles on the left one-by-one to get a feel for it.
