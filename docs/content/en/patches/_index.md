Hex patches (also referred to as file patches) are the older method of building datatable mods for Project Wingman. They involve directly editing the binary parts of game files, replacing certain bytes with new bytes (generally represented in hex form). This approach still works, and it still _supported_ by Project Sicario, but is not recommended for most scenarios as it is less robust, more likely to break in case of game updates and is just generally kinda messy.

With that in mind, Sicario was built with hex patching in mind so file patching is still very much supported and documentation for working with hex patches is still included.
