        At it's simplest, a Project Sicario patch is just a JSON file with a specific structure and a different file extension.
    </Paragraph>
    <Paragraph>
        I'd recommend using a JSON-aware editor (I personally use VS Code) for this, since it might catch small errors and make authoring the patch objects easier. Again, a Project Sicario patch file is just a JSON file with a `.dtm` file extension that the app will try and load.

    <Paragraph>I think the easiest way to demonstrate how a Sicario patch works is to show you a simple one, so we'll walk through a reasonably simple one: the AoA Unlocker</Paragraph>
