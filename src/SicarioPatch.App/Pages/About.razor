<Paragraph>
    In general, a datatable mod is any mod that modifies the structures that Project Wingman uses to store a lot of variables and records used in the game. In particular, most mods that change aircraft statistics, capabilities or weapons are usually datatable mods, which are frequently incompatible with each other because of how the game loads mods.

<DisplayHeading Size="DisplayHeadingSize.Is4">How does it work?</DisplayHeading>
<Paragraph>
    The mods available in Project Sicario are not actually complete mods: they're simple files that define the <em>changes</em> to the game's datatables rather than recreating them. When you pick your mods and build a merged mod, @Brand.AppName will apply those edits in order to the vanilla game files and produce a single mod.
