        Project Sicario is an <strong>experimental</strong> new way of building and merging certain mods for Project Wingman. The Sicario Patcher can attempt to "merge" multiple data table edits together into a single mod to improve compatibility and user choices.

    <Paragraph>
        In general, a datatable mod is any mod that modifies the structures that Project Wingman uses to store a lot of variables and records used in the game. In particular, most mods that change aircraft statistics, capabilities or weapons are usually datatable mods, which are frequently incompatible with each other because of how the game loads mods.
