        In general, a datatable mod is any mod that modifies the structures that @Brand.GameName uses to store a lot of variables and records used in the game. In particular, most mods that change aircraft statistics, capabilities or weapons are usually datatable mods, which are frequently incompatible with each other because of how the game loads mods.
